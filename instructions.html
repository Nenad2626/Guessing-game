Welcome to the Guessing game.Your goal is to guess the number of squares same color, before the time is up.Game contains 20 levels.Every next five levels are harder than previous five.

<br>
<br>

If headline says: "Count orange squares", you are counting their number,then in empty rectangle type for example 5 orange, press Enter and if your answer is correct alert box should pop up with the text-"THAT IS CORRECT ANSWER".If you don't time will continue to run. 
	

<br>
<br>

If headline says : "Count blue and black squares", you are typing for example 5 blue 5 black.Don't write 5 black and 5 blue, answer will be incorrect.Same with : "Count red, yellow and green squares".You type 4 red,3 yellow,2 green without colons.Also every new five levels adds more time in stopwatch.
